Releasing [Snake Charmer](https://github.com/andrewclegg/snake-charmer) has inspired me to start blogging again, so welcome to the new blog.

I've had a couple of Wordpress blogs in the past, but this time I've decided to give [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) a go, for a bit more control. And because Markdown and Python.

Pelican's basically a toolkit for rendering source documents (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc) as static HTML pages, and generating all the usual blogging extras like index pages, category pages and so on. It's very flexible, hackable, scriptable and command-line-driven, which is ideal for me. So let's see how it goes.

A note on the blog title, in case you're interested. There's an [often](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/scientocracy/201401/the-plural-anecdote-is-not-data)-[quoted](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/634fb176-bf3f-11e3-b924-00144feabdc0.html#axzz33YVGNMQM) quotation that goes "the plural of anecdote is not data," referring to the comparative credibility of different kinds of evidence. Or at least, many people seem to think that's how it goes &mdash; but without any particular reason to believe so. Ironically, the original quote was "[the plural of anecdote *is* data](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/04/the-plural-of-anecdote-is-data-after-all.html)" (my emphasis).
