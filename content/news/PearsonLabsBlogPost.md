Summary: I recently gave a talk at the Big Data Innovation Summit called Lies, Damned Lies & Dataviz: Bad visualization, and how to avoid it. The aim: educate and entertain.

I recently gave a talk at the [Big Data Innovation Summit](http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/big-data-innovation-summit-london-2014/) called [Lies, Damned Lies & Dataviz: Bad visualization, and how to avoid it](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/lies-damned-lies-dataviz). The aim: educate and entertain. I'm not above resorting to mockery when a graphic is particularly incompetent or manipulative, and I've never had that many laughs from a conference crowd before.

Pearson Labs asked to write up a short blog post version which is [here](http://labs.pearson.com/lies-damned-lies-dataviz-when-data-visualization-goes-wrong/) &mdash; enjoy. And if you liked that, I'll be revisiting the same subject at a [Skills Matter event in November](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1959-big-data-exchange-2014#program).
