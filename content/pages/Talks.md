Title: Talks, slides & videos

#### Upcoming events

In November 2014 I'm speaking at two events:

* [Chief Data Officer Summit](http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/chief-data-officer-summit-london) on "Big Data, and other myths" -- an extended version of "There's no such thing as Big Data".
* [Big Data eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1959-big-data-exchange-2014) on "Lies, damned lies and dataviz", a slightly more polished version of the earlier talk with the same name.

#### Slides and videos from past events

I ran a [Snake Charmer](https://github.com/snake-charmer-devs/snake-charmer) intro/tutorial at [PyData London](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/) in August 2014. Slides are [here](../pdfs/IntroToSnakeCharmer.pdf) and the demo notebook is [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/snake-charmer-devs/snake-charmer/blob/master/notebooks/Demo/Wikipedia%20edit%20stream.ipynb) -- note that the D3 demo at the end won't work via nbviewer, as it's in an iframe.

Slides from an earlier version of [Lies, damned lies and dataviz](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/lies-damned-lies-dataviz), at the Big Data Innovation Summit 2014.

Slides from two Elasticsearch London meetups: [Tuning Elasticsearch for multi-terabyte analytics](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/scaling-elasticsearch-for-multiterabyte-analytics) and [Cardinality estimation in Elasticsearch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESNiqd7HuIfuwXSSK81PAAu6AmEPEE0u_vyk4FU5x9o/edit?usp=sharing). The latter is a little out of date as a very similar feature is now [included with Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html).

Slides and video from QCon entitled [Approximate methods for scalable data mining](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scalability-data-mining). This covers the theory behind the cardinality estimation technique we used in Elasticsearch, amongst other things.

Video from a Big-O London meetup: [Scaling up k-nearest neighbours classification](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4930-scaling-up-k-nearest-neighbours-classification).

Video from a Hadoop UK User Group meetup on [Data mining with Pig](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3384-data-processing-pig).

By far my most-viewed deck: a short talk from 2013 entitled [There's no such thing as big data](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/theres-no-such-thing-as-big-datappt).
