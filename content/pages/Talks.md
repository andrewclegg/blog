Title: Talks, slides & videos

#### Upcoming events

In June 2014 I'm on a [panel discussion about big data](http://www.itleadersforum.co.uk/speakers) hosted by [Computing](http://www.computing.co.uk/).

In November I'll be speaking at [Big Data eXchange 2014](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1959-big-data-exchange-2014) on "Lies, damned lies and dataviz."

#### Slides and videos from past events

Slides from an earlier version of [Lies, damned lies and dataviz](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/lies-damned-lies-dataviz), at the Big Data Innovation Summit 2014.

Slides from two Elasticsearch London meetups: [Tuning Elasticsearch for multi-terabyte analytics](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/scaling-elasticsearch-for-multiterabyte-analytics) and [Cardinality estimation in Elasticsearch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESNiqd7HuIfuwXSSK81PAAu6AmEPEE0u_vyk4FU5x9o/edit?usp=sharing). The latter is a little out of date as a very similar feature is now [included with Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html).

Slides and video from QCon entitled [Approximate methods for scalable data mining](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scalability-data-mining). This covers the theory behind the cardinality estimation technique we used in Elasticsearch, amongst other things.

Video from a Big-O London meetup: [Scaling up k-nearest neighbours classification](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4930-scaling-up-k-nearest-neighbours-classification).

Video from a Hadoop UK User Group meetup on [Data mining with Pig](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3384-data-processing-pig).

By far my most-viewed deck: a short talk from 2013 entitled [There's no such thing as big data](http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewClegg1/theres-no-such-thing-as-big-datappt).
