Title: About

I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer based in London, and this is my blog.

Most of what I do these days is related to recommendations, search quality, personalization, and other ways to improve user experience through data mining. I've worked at [Etsy](http://etsy.com/), [Pearson](http://labs.pearson.com/), [Last.fm](http://last.fm/), [Smesh](http://sme.sh/), the University of London's [Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology](http://www.ismb.lon.ac.uk/), and [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), among others. My academic background is in natural language processing, text mining and bioinformatics. Have a look at my [talks and workshops page](Talks.html) for more on my projects inside and outside of working hours.
