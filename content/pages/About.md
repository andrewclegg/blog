Title: About

I'm a data scientist based in London, and this is my blog.

If you're not sure what a data scientist is, [this](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html) is a pretty good intro, although the tech landscape has changed significantly since 2010. In practice, it means a bit of maths and stats, a bit of programming and architecture, a bit of visual design, and lots of counting things and measuring stuff. It means digging around in data to find answers to complex questions, and occasionally it means predicting the future. In some ways it resembles being an [actual scientist](Publications.html), but it's much more varied.

I work at [Etsy](http://etsy.com/) on recommendations, search quality, personalization, and other ways to use data to improve user experience, as well as hacking on internal tools for operational data mining, anomaly detection, visualization and more. Have a look at my [talks and workshops page](Talks.html) for more on my projects inside and outside of working hours.

Previously I've worked at [Pearson](http://labs.pearson.com/), [Last.fm](http://last.fm/), [Smesh](http://sme.sh/), the University of London's [Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology](http://www.ismb.lon.ac.uk/), and [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), among others. My academic background is in natural language processing, text mining and bioinformatics.
