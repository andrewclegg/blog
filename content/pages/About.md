Title: About

I'm a data scientist based in London, and this is my blog.

If you're not sure what a data scientist is, [this](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html) is a pretty good intro. In practice, it means a bit of maths and stats, a bit of programming and architecture, a bit of visual design, and lots of counting things and measuring stuff. It means digging around in data to find answers to complex questions, and occasionally it means predicting the future. In some ways it resembles being an [actual scientist](Publications.html), but it's much more varied.

My day job is at [Pearson](http://labs.pearson.com/), where we put these techniques to work on the challenges of education in the 21st century. In my spare time, I maintain a Python-based data science toolkit called [Snake Charmer](https://github.com/andrewclegg/snake-charmer). Previously I've worked at [Last.fm](http://last.fm/), [Smesh](http://sme.sh/), the University of London's [Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology](http://www.ismb.lon.ac.uk/), and [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/), among others. My academic background is in natural language processing, text mining and bioinformatics.
